# gamify-bot

The **GamifyBot** is a [Slack](https://slack.com/) chat bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to gamify shared team tasks assignement in agile teams.

All development teams have **routine tasks** that need to be **shared among team members**, for instance:
- Analysis of support issues before inserting them in the team's backlog
- Performing routine merges or backports
- Fixing quality gates on the team's master branch
- Etc.

Experience has shown that **team members are reluctant to perform those tasks**, perceived as having a low value, low visibility (a.k.a *boring*), and usually a few team mates are taking ownership of most of these routine tasks.

In order to **bring back fun to these routine tasks**, and to **even out the load on the team**, we decided to experiment with gamification, and the idea of **GamifyBot** was born during a team retrospective!
